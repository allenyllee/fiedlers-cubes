					Important: Missing functionality!
					
					In order to keep the state completely in sync via P2P
					it is necessary to add the concept of reverse corrections.

					The basic idea of reverse corrections is that you keep track 
					of the set of objects you *expect* to be activated for other
					players, then you pre-emptively send state updates for those 
					objects which you think they have active, but have not received
					state updates for yet.
					
					This solves the case where the red player goes katamari and 
					dumps a whole load of cubes in the blue players circle while
					sync is OFF, then moves away, then you turn sync ON.
					
					Without reverse corrections the extra cubes do not show up 
					in the blue player's circle until the red player rolls
					over and overlaps them.

					No time to code this before MIGS'09 so I have to release
					the demo without it. Sorry guys!
